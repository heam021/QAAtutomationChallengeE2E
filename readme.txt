Project: QAAutomation Challenge E2E 
Playwright.

This project requires the following:
Install Visual Studio Code.
Install Node js

You need to have Playwright dependencies installed.
npm init playwright@latest

To run the project use the command 
npx playwright test 

To view the report use the command:
npx playwright show-report

There is the possibility of generating a report with allure but the information that 
playwright provides by itself is very accurate.
